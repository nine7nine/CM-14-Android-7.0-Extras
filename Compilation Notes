This file is to keep track of compilation strategies that I use. This would include; switching compilers, 
adding FLAGS to the build, enabling ODEX'ing a ROM, etc... 

NOTE: since I lost all of my CM13 configs migrating to CM14, this will be helpful to document these things.

# Odexing Roms

I prefer to odex my AOSP/CM roms. It's easy to do, add;

# ODEX

WITH_DEXPREOPT := true

to ../BoardConfig.mk (ie: your product's BoardConfig.mk).
